Above is the video demo, as well as explanation of what and what is not working.

On Linux with docker installed, the docker application can be run by running run.sh within the docker folder.

On other operating systems, assuming x11 forwarding is set up it can be run with <code>docker run romangvk/search-project</code>

Like I said in the video, I wasn't able to link the UI Containerized app with GCP. However, InvertedIndices and TopN are both fully functioning on my dataproc, as shown in the video.
